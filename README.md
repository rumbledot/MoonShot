A two weeks worth of a procedurally generated moon farming game prototype.
Player can jump from moon to moon using his trustee 'you-f-oh'.
The goal is to build a sprawling farming industry, build space station and colony.
Tasks are gathering resources, planting crops that only live on certain moon, managing alien pests.

ToDos:
- atmospheric scattering
- LOD
- GUI
- scripts tidy up
- pests
- more diverse biome
- better shaders
